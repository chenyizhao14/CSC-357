No special instructions to run.

This was honestly one of the most difficult assignments I've done so far.
I think for the first couple of days, whenever I read the instructions,
or started thinking about how to write it, my brain would overheat and 
I'd fall asleep. Whenever I need to think critically about something,
I tend to pass out. 

I wrote the code the first time around, and rewrote everything again in
attempt to figure out what was going wrong and to look through the code more 
thoroughly.
