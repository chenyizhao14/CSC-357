# CSC 357 Systems Programming @ Cal Poly SLO
## Professor Dr. Philip Nico - Spring 2023

## The Course
This class was extremely difficult. I cannot stress this enough, but if you want to do well in this class, DO NOT procrastinate. 
Professor Nico pushes you past boundaries with these brain-racking assignments. I have never worked as hard as I have for this class than 2 or 3 other classes combined. I remember crying my eyes out after spending 10 hours straight trying to debug my code, starting a completely fresh file and restarting.
As much as I wished I didn't hold these labs and assignments to the very last minute, it happened. From my previous experience in the other CS classes, one to two days were all I needed to crank out everything. After finishing my classes for the day, I'd sit down for an hour, get into the mode, and finish everything before midnight.
Unfortunately, that was the one technique that would never work for this class. I learned so many valuable lessons from this class that wouldn't have been possible elsewhere. 

I hope my code only serves as a guideline or a small push for you to get back on track. Please don't copy my code, because I want you to learn the same lessons I did, and grow as a student and a programmer.

Once you finish this course, you're going to think "If I got through this, I can do anything"
